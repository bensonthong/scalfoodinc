      Rice noodles and wonton noodles are two popular types of noodles commonly
      found in Asian cuisine. Rice noodles are made from rice flour and water,
      and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Wonton noodles, on the other
      hand, are made from wheat flour, egg, and water, and are typically thin
      and springy in texture. Both types of noodles are versatile and can be
      used in a variety of dishes, from soups and stir-fries to salads and
      noodle bowls.
